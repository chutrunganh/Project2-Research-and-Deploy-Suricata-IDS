> [!IMPORTANT]
> In this file, I will show you how to set up Suricata IDS on a standalone VM using Ubuntu 24.04 LTS as the base OS. After testing and verifying that Suricata IDS is working correctly, I will export it as a `qcow2` image file and import it into PnetLab, where we have set up the entire network environment.

*At the time of writing, Ubuntu 25.04 is the latest version. However, it is not an LTS release yet, and the PPA does not yet provide the Suricata package for this version (as I have tested). Therefore, we will use Ubuntu 24.04 LTS for this lab.*


# 1. Install Ubuntu Server 24.04 VM

Create a new VM in VMware Workstation Pro 17:

![alt text](image-50.png)

Choose the ISO file of Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS that you have downloaded.

![alt text](image-51.png)

Name the VM as you prefer and choose the location to save it. We will use several VM files in this lab so it is recommended to create a new separate folder for each VM.

![alt text](image-52.png)

Everything else can be left as default, or modify based on your machine configuration. After that the VM will be created, before you start the machine, recheck the network adapter setting of this VM, make sure it has the adapter type that can connect to the Internet (such as Bridge or NAT, which should be the default setting while installing).


![alt text](image-53.png)

Then start the VM, at this step, I choose the minimal installation option for lowest resource usage:

![alt text](image-54.png)
*Press Arrow Down to select the option, then press Space to select it, then move to the bottom (Done) and press Enter to continue.*

Press Enter to for next steps. Remember to choose `Install OpenSSH server` option, so that you can connect to this VM via SSH later.

![alt text](image-55.png)

Then wait until the installation is complete. This may take a few minutes, after that we can SSH to this VM from the host machine.

To SSH from host machine, first you still need to login to the VM console  then run the following commands:

```bash
ip a # To see the IP address that we need to SSH to
sudo systemctl status ssh # To check if SSH service is running
# Incase the SSH service is not running or on error, it is likely that the key haven't been generated for the first time yet, run this command: "sudo ssh-keygen -A" should fix the issue
```

# 2. Install Suricata IDS on the VM

Now we can SSH to the VM from the host machine. Open a terminal on your host machine and run:

```bash
ssh chutrunganh@192.168.249.129 # Replace with your VM username and IP address, this will let us enter the VM console

# Once entered, run these commands:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install open-vm-tools # Install VMware tools for better performance and integration (recommended, not install this can sometime cause some issues when displaying the VM console, related to the GPU)
sudo apt install nano iputils-ping -y
# If you choose to install the minimal Ubuntu Server install option, these tools are not installed by default, so we need to install them manually. Make sure to choose the NAT or Bridge network adapter type so that the VM can connect to the Internet and install packages.
```

*In case you encounter some issues with displaying the VM console, try to install the VMware tools as shown above, or you can also disable `3D Acceleration graphics` in the VM settings: Click on that VM -> Edit -> Display -> **uncheck `Accelerate 3D graphics` option**, this may fix the display issues.*

Now we can install Suricata IDS on this VM.

```bash
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:oisf/suricata-stable # Add the Suricata PPA repository
sudo apt update # Update the package list
sudo apt install suricata -y # Install Suricata IDS
sudo systemctl enable suricata # Enable Suricata to start on boot
```
Expected output:

```plaintext
chutrunganh@chutrunganh:~$ sudo systemctl enable suricata
Synchronizing state of suricata.service with SysV service script with /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install.
Executing: /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install enable suricata

We can check for the status of Suricata service by running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status suricata
```

```

# 3. Configure Suricata IDS

## Initial Configuration

By default, when installed, Suricata works in IDS mode, (to enable IPS will require further configuration, which is not covered in this lab). We can check the Suricata configuration file at `/etc/suricata/suricata.yaml`.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml
```

Here are some important settings that you may want to change:

- **`HOME_NET`**: This is the network address range that Suricata will monitor. Change this to match your network. 
    
  ```yaml
  vars:
    # more specific is better for alert accuracy and performance
    address-groups:
      HOME_NET: "[192.168.0.0/16,10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12]"
      #HOME_NET: "[192.168.0.0/16]"
      #HOME_NET: "[10.0.0.0/8]"
      #HOME_NET: "[172.16.0.0/12]"
      #HOME_NET: "any"
  ```

  As in my case, my VM are using NAT network adapter with IP address 192.168.249.0/24 (and in the PnetLab topology am I desiging using 10.0.0.0/24), so I need to change this to `[192.168.249.0/24, 10.0.0.0/24,172.16.0.0/12]`. The more specific the network address range is, the better the alert accuracy and performance will be.

- **`EXTERNAL_NET`**: This is the network address range that Suricata will consider as external. By default, it is set to `!$HOME_NET`, which means everything that is not in the HOME_NET range. You can change this if you want to monitor a different external network.


- **`default-log-dir`**: This is the directory where Suricata will store its log files. Just need to view, no need to change this.

  ```yaml
  default-log-dir: /var/log/suricata/
  # Global stats configuration
  stats:
    enabled: yes
    # The interval field (in seconds) controls the interval at
    # which stats are updated in the log.
    interval: 8
    # Add decode events to stats.
  outputs:
    # a line based alerts log similar to Snort's fast.log
    - fast:
        enabled: yes
        filename: fast.log
        append: yes

    # Extensible Event Format (nicknamed EVE) event log in JSON format
    - eve-log:
        enabled: yes
        filetype: regular #regular|syslog|unix_dgram|unix_stream|redis
        filename: eve.json

        ...
        # enable/disable the community id feature.
        community-id: false
        # Seed value for the ID output. Valid values are 0-65535.
        community-id-seed: 0
  ```

  By default, Suricata will log its alerts to `/var/log/suricata/`, it offers two main types of log. When an event occurs, Suricata will log that event in both log files:
  - **`fast.log`**: This log file contains a concise, just a text line, human-readable summary of alerts.
  - **`eve.json`**: This is a more detailed log file in JSON format, whose purpose is for deeper analysis and integration with other tools that collect and analyze logs, such as ELK stack or Splunk. To integrate with these tools, you also need to enable the `Community ID` feature, change it to `true` in the configuration file. This ID is used to uniquely identify events across different systems and tools, allowing logs from different sources to be merged together in a consistent timeline.

  We can also change the `interval` value to control how often Suricata updates its stats in the log.

- **`af-packet`**: This is the interface that Suricata will use to capture network traffic. Make sure it is set to the correct interface that you want to monitor. You can find your network interfaces by running `ip a` command.

  ```yaml
  af-packet:
    - interface: eth0
    cluster-id: 99
  ```

  In the VM, the network interface is usually named as `ens33` so remember to change this. In case you want to use multiple interfaces, you can add more entries under the `af-packet` section like this:

  ```yaml
  af-packet:
    - interface: ens33
      cluster-id: 99
    - interface: ens34
      cluster-id: 100
  ```
  Notice that the `cluster-id` of each interface must be unique.

- **`default-rule-path`**: This is the path where Suricata will look for its rules files. By default, it is set to `/var/lib/suricata/rules`. You can change this if you want to store your rules in a different location.

  ```yaml
  rule-path: /var/lib/suricata/rules
  rule-files:
    - suricata.rules
  ```

## Live Rules Loading

Suricata supports live rules loading, which means you can add or remove rules without restarting Suricata. This is useful for testing new rules or updating existing ones without downtime. Reopen the Suricata configuration file, move to the end of the file, and **add** the following lines:

```yaml
detect-engine:
  - rule-reload: true
```

With this, whenever you add or remove rules, you can run the following command to reload the rules without restarting Suricata: (see more details [here](https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/rule-management/rule-reload.html)

```bash
kill -USR2 $(pidof suricata)
```
*Only when Suricata running in daemon mode this command will work, otherwise it does not have any effect. If you run Suricata in test mode, it will not work.*

## Add Rules

You can write and add your own rules to Suricata (which we will do in later sections), or you can use the rules that are pre-written by many providers. Suricata offers a tool called `suricata-update` to manage these. We use:

```bash
sudo suricata-update update-sources # for Suricata to update its provider sources first
suricata-update list-sources
``` 
to list all available sources of rules. You can choose one or more sources to use.

Rules with a `Commercial` license require a subscription to use, so we will not use them in this lab. In this project, I will use the `et/open` ruleset (Emerging Threats Open Ruleset) from Proofpoint, which is a free and open-source ruleset. This ruleset is widely used and maintained by the community, making it a good choice for testing and learning purposes. To add this ruleset, run:

```bash
sudo suricata-update enable-source et/open
```

Then run the following command to update the rules:

```bash
sudo suricata-update update
```

To check which rules are currently enabled, you can run:

```bash
sudo suricata-update list-sources --enabled
```
Expected output:

```plaintext

3/6/2025 -- 03:37:04 - <Info> -- Found Suricata version 7.0.10 at /usr/bin/suricata.
Enabled sources:
  - et/open
```

After all the configuration, run Suricata in test mode to check if everything is working correctly:

```bash
sudo suricata -T -c /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml -v
```

With the `-T` option, Suricata will run in test mode and check the configuration file for any errors. The `-c` option specifies the configuration file to use, and the `-v` option enables verbose output.
Expected output:

```plaintext

Notice: suricata: Configuration provided was successfully loaded. Exiting.
```

If things go well, you should see a message indicating that Suricata is running in test mode and that the configuration file was successfully loaded. Then we can start Suricata in daemon mode:

```bash
sudo systemctl start suricata
sudo systemctl status suricata
```

If any errors occur, you can check the Suricata runtime log file for more details:
```bash
tail -f /var/log/suricata/suricata.log
```
*This is the log file of Suricata runtime, not the alert log file.*

## Some basic testing

To test if Suricata is working correctly, we can use some simple commands to generate traffic and see if Suricata detects it. For example, this script is normally used to test Suricata:

```bash
# run this command on Suricata machine
curl http://testmynids.org/uid/index.html 
```
Expected output:

```plaintext
chutrunganh@chutrunganh:~$ curl http://testmynids.org/uid/index.html
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

This will send an HTTP request to http://testmynids.org/uid/index.html. The server responds with content resembling the output of the Unix id command for the root user: `uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)`
This specific response is designed to match a known signature used in IDS rules to simulate an attack response. For more details, it is triggered by the following rule in the `et/open` ruleset that we enabled earlier:

```plaintext
alert ip any any -> any any (msg:"GPL ATTACK_RESPONSE id check returned root"; content:"uid=0|28|root|29|"; classtype:bad-unknown; sid:2100498; rev:7;)
```
If Suricata is working correctly, it should log this event in both `fast.log` and `eve.json` files. You can check the logs by running:

- For fast log:
```bash
tail -f /var/log/suricata/fast.log
```
Expected output:

```plaintext
chutrunganh@chutrunganh:~$ tail -f /var/log/suricata/fast.log
06/03/2025-03:15:48.391288  [**] [1:2100498:7] GPL ATTACK_RESPONSE id check returned root [**] [Classification: Potentially Bad Traffic] [Priority: 2] {TCP} 108.157.32.102:80 -> 192.168.249.131:52324
```

- For eve log:

```bash
sudo apt install jq # Install jq to parse JSON output for better readability
jq 'select(.alert .signature_id==2100498)' /var/log/suricata/eve.json # This will filter the eve.json file to show only the events with signature_id 2100498  (the signature ID of the rule as we see in the alert of fast.log  )
```

Expected output:

# 4. Write some custom rules and test them

Now we can write some custom rules to test Suricata. For example, we can create a rule to detect a specific string in the HTTP request. Create a new file called `custom.rules` in the Suricata rules directory:

```bash
sudo nano /var/lib/suricata/rules/custom.rules
```

Then add this rules path to the Suricata configuration file at `/etc/suricata/suricata.yaml` under the `rule-files` section:

```yaml
rule-files:
  - suricata.rules # Can temporarily comment this line out to disable the default rules
  - custom.rules # Add this line to include the custom rules file
```

Then send a kill signal to Suricata to reload the rules each time you add or modify the rules in the `custom.rules` file:

```bash
sudo kill -USR2 $(pidof suricata)
```

Here are some rules that I wrote or referred from sources to test:

## Alert on reconnaissance activity

Here are some rules written by me to detect some common reconnaissance activities with Nmap:

```plaintext

alert tcp any any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"[SCAN] TCP FIN Scan Detected"; flags:F; threshold:type threshold, track by_src, count 3, seconds 10; sid:1000012; rev:1;)

# Rule 4: Detect Xmas Scan (FIN, PSH, URG flags)
alert tcp any any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"[SCAN] TCP Xmas Scan Detected"; flags:FPUR; threshold:type threshold, track by_src, count 3, seconds 10; sid:1000013; rev:1;)

# Rule 6: Detect UDP Scan (probing UDP ports)
alert udp any any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"[SCAN] UDP Port Scan Detected"; threshold:type threshold, track by_src, count 5, seconds 10; sid:1000015; rev:1;)

# Rule 7: Detect Nmap OS Fingerprinting (TCP SYN with unusual window size)
alert tcp any any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"[SCAN] Nmap OS Fingerprinting Attempt (Odd Window Size)"; flags:S; window:1024; threshold:type threshold, track by_src, count 3, seconds 10; sid:1000016; rev:1;)

# Rule 8: Detect TCP packets with uncommon options (often used in -O scan)
alert tcp any any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"[SCAN] TCP Packet with Uncommon Options (Possibly Nmap)"; tcp_options:!mss,!sack,!ts,!wscale; threshold:type threshold, track by_src, count 3, seconds 10; sid:1000017; rev:1;)

# Rule 9: Detect Nmap Service Detection (-sV) based on known banner grabbing patterns
alert tcp any any -> $HOME_NET 21,22,23,25,80,110,443,3306,3389 (msg:"[SCAN] Nmap Service Detection Attempt"; flow:to_server,established; content:"SSH-"; nocase; sid:1000018; rev:1;)

# Rule 10: Detect Aggressive Scans (Nmap -A typically combines everything)
alert ip any any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"[SCAN] Aggressive Nmap Scan Detected"; threshold:type threshold, track by_src, count 15, seconds 10; sid:1000019; rev:1;)
```
*Some rules still do not raise alerts yet, to be fixed later.*

- Testing with Nmap for **TCP SYN Scan** (`192.168.249.131` is the Suricata VM IP address, run these attack commands on an attacker VM that is in the same network as the Suricata VM)
